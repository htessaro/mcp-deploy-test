# Setup & Configuration

## Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `TypeScript >= 4.8.4`

## Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `npm`:

```bash
npm install mcp-server
```

## Authentication

### Access Token Authentication

The McpServer API uses an Access Token for authentication.

This token must be provided to authenticate your requests to the API.

#### Setting the Access Token

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the access token as follows:

```ts
const sdk = new McpServer({ token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' });
```

If you need to set or update the access token after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```ts
const sdk = new McpServer();
sdk.token = 'YOUR_TOKEN';
```

## Setting a Custom Timeout

You can set a custom timeout for the SDK's HTTP requests as follows:

```ts
const mcpServer = new McpServer({ timeout: 10000 });
```

# Sample Usage

Below is a comprehensive example demonstrating how to authenticate and call a simple endpoint:

```ts
import { McpServer } from 'mcp-server';

(async () => {
  const mcpServer = new McpServer({
    token: 'YOUR_TOKEN',
  });

  const { data } = await mcpServer.images.imagesListSearchOrRandom({
    size: 'size',
    mimeTypes: 'mime_types',
    format: 'format',
    hasBreeds: true,
    order: 'order',
    page: 2,
    limit: 9,
    contentType: 'Content-Type',
    xApiKey: 'x-api-key',
  });

  console.log(data);
})();
```
