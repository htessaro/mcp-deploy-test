# Setup & Configuration

## Local usage requirements

To get started with the MCP, we recommend installing [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Steps to run it locally

1. Open a terminal, go to the root folder of this project and run the command:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This command will establish a linkage between the MCP server and the SDK, install the required dependencies, and compile the project.

2. Copy this object into the MCP configuration file in your client:

```bash
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "liblab": {
                "command": "node",
                "args": [
                    "YOUR_FOLDER_ROOT_PATH/dist/index.js"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
```

Substitute "YOUR_FOLDER_ROOT_PATH" with the absolute path to the directory containing the MCP server.

## Use arguments

```bash
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "liblab": {
                "command": "node",
                "args": [
                    "YOUR_FOLDER_ROOT_PATH/dist/index.js"
                ],
                "env": {
                        "BASE_URL": "YOUR_SECRET_VALUE_HERE",
                        "TOKEN": "YOUR_SECRET_VALUE_HERE",
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

## Environment Variables

These are the environment variables for the MCP:

| Name     | Description                                                  |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| BASE_URL | Optional - This variable will override the default API host. |
| TOKEN    | Token required for authentication.                           |

Environment variables are a way to configure your application outside the code.

You will have to configure these variables in your client configuration file.

## Tools

The MCP includes several tools that represent the data structures used in API requests and responses. These tools help in organizing and managing the data efficiently.

| images_list_search_or_random                 | Searches or returns Random selection from all approved images.

Pagination-Count, Pagination-Page, and Pagination-Limit headers are present in the response so you know the total number of images that can be paginated through for the passed search filters. |

| get_breeds_by_breed_id_facts                 | Get one or more facts about the Species. For more at a time just update the 'limit' field, and to paginate through them just increment the 'page' field. The response headers have the pagination details, such as how many there are in total, what page you're on, and the current amount per page. To redorder change the order to ASC for ascending order, DESC for descending, and RAND for random order.                                                      |
